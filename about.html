                <h1 class="card-title">OPPS USING JAVA</h1>
                <p class="card-text">Definition of OOP Concepts in Java The main ideas behind Java’s Object-Oriented Programming, OOP concepts include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create working methods and
                    variables, then re-use all or part of them without compromising security. Grasping OOP concepts is key to understanding how Java works. Java defines OOP concepts as follows: Abstraction. Using simple things to represent complexity.
                    We all know how to turn the TV on, but we don’t need to know how it works in order to enjoy it. In Java, abstraction means simple things like objects, classes and variables represent more complex underlying code and data. This is important
                    because it lets you avoid repeating the same work multiple times. Encapsulation. The practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to those fields via public methods. Encapsulation is a protective barrier
                    that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. We can then reuse objects like code components or variables without allowing open access to the data system-wide. Inheritance. A special feature of Object-Oriented Programming
                    in Java, Inheritance lets programmers create new classes that share some of the attributes of existing classes. Using Inheritance lets us build on previous work without reinventing the wheel. Polymorphism. Allows programmers to use
                    the same word in Java to mean different things in different contexts. One form of polymorphism is method overloading. That’s when the code itself implies different meanings. The other form is method overriding. That’s when the values
                    of the supplied variables imply different meanings. Let’s delve a little further.

                    <p class="card-text">Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. This tutorial will give you a great understanding
                        on Data Structures needed to understand the complexity of enterprise level applications and need of algorithms, and data structures.

                        <h3>Why to Learn Data Structure and Algorithms?</h3>
                        As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now-a-days. Data Search − Consider an inventory of 1 million(106) items of a store. If the application is to search an item, it has to search an
                        item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, search will become slower. Processor speed − Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records. Multiple
                        requests − As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data. To solve the above-mentioned problems, data structures come to rescue. Data can be organized
                        in a data structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be searched almost instantly.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Python is a very popular programming language today and often needs an introduction. It is widely used in various business sectors, such as programming, web development, machine learning, and data science. Given its widespread use,
                        it's not surprising that Python has surpassed Java as the top programming language. Python Features Python provides many useful features which make it popular and valuable from the other programming languages. It supports object-oriented
                        programming, procedural programming approaches and provides dynamic memory allocation. We have listed below a few essential features. 1) Easy to Learn and Use Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages.
                        Its syntax is straightforward and much the same as the English language. There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners. 2) Expressive
                        Language Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code. A simple example, the hello world program you simply type print("Hello World"). It will take only one line to execute, while Java or C takes multiple lines. 3)
                        Interpreted Language Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable. 4) Cross-platform Language Python
                        can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language. It enables programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms by writing
                        a program only once. 5) Free and Open Source Python is freely available for everyone. It is freely available on its official website www.python.org. It has a large community across the world that is dedicatedly working towards
                        make new python modules and functions. Anyone can contribute to the Python community. The open-source means, "Anyone can download its source code without paying any penny." 6) Object-Oriented Language Python supports object-oriented
                        language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications
                        in less code. 7) Extensible It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our Python code. It converts the program into byte code, and any platform can use that
                        byte code. 8) Large Standard Library It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web developer, and also for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor
                        flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc. Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development. 9) GUI Programming Support Graphical User Interface is used for the developing Desktop application. PyQT5,
                        Tkinter, Kivy are the libraries which are used for developing the web application. 10) Integrated It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, and JAVA, etc. Python runs code line by line like C,C++ Java. It makes easy
                        to debug the code. 11. Embeddable The code of the other programming language can use in the Python source code. We can use Python source code in another programming language as well. It can embed other language into our code. 12.
                        Dynamic Memory Allocation In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable. When we assign some value to the variable, it automatically allocates the memory to the variable at run time. Suppose we are assigned
                        integer value 15 to x, then we don't need to write int x = 15. Just write x = 15.</p>
