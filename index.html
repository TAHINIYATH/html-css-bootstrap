                                <h1>Importance of coding</h1>
                                Learning code is, in a broad sense, like learning any language – or to be more accurate, a family of languages. There are overarching rules that all scripts follow, but also very precise rules for each. It’s not an exaggeration that coding is the DNA
                                of the digital world. Every phone app, website, computer programme, and even many kitchen appliances rely on coding to work. This is why coders have such a prominent position in the shaping of the modern age, and the future.
                                It is anticipated that over the next decade that there will be a massive shortfall in the number of computer science graduates able to occupy the coding careers available. This signifies the proliferation of coding into
                                many different industries. In fact, computer sciences are becoming a key element in many diverse areas of work, such as medicine and banking, where insight of programming and coding is of increasing relevance and importance.

                                <h1>Where coding is used?</h1>
                                As touched upon above, coding has becomeing the framework for the modern world and coders act as architects of these constructs. Consequently, skilled coders are in high demand. Their skills are used in creating mobile phone and desktop apps, and popular
                                websites such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. There are many different programming languages, each with a different purpose of increasing and diminishing usefulness. Along with Python, PHP, and C#, here are
                                some of the most widely used: Java: This is a general purpose language used especially with desktop software, Android phones and tablets, a great many websites, and in embedded systems such as the chip used to run a washing
                                machine, for instance. Javascript: although similar in name to Java, it has almost no relation to it. In fact, it has been said that Java and Javascript are similar in the way Ham and Hamster are similar. Javascript was
                                originally made to add front-end, in-browser functionality to web pages, such as with Gmail and eBay, where it enables an entire application to run within a web browser. Now people are finding new ways to utilise Javascript
                                as a general purpose programming language. C: This extremely fast language is largely used for writing operating systems, device drivers, and other programming languages. It also has use in programming embedded systems,
                                with good performance. C++: Built on C, there is actually a lot of overlap with C. C++ is used predominately with 3D games. It is rarely used with websites, unless they are highly-optimised. The specific quality of C++
                                is in being able to manage memory very efficiently, which is useful when smooth real-time execution is needed.
